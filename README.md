Simple jump and shoot game written in assembly, based on the [processor](https://github.com/simoesusp/Processador-ICMC) developed by ICMC-USP, under the guidance of professor [Eduardo do Valle Sim√µes](https://github.com/simoesusp)

## Installation and Usage
To run the game, access the project of the processor mentioned above, and use the simulator to run the game
To play, there are four basic commands
 - Use "Space" on the initial screen to start the game
 - Use "w" to jump and avoid obstacles
 - Use "s" to shoot and destroy obstacles
 - Use "r" on the Game Over screen to return to the Start Screen

## Known bugs
Currently, there is a bug where, at times, the shot hits the obstacle, but it's ignored, so it's not destroyed and the points don't change. 

## Ideas for improvement
The game can be further developed to becoma a platform game. For this, here are a few ideas on what to add:
 - Feature to move the character horizontally, allowing it to walk on the screen
 - Add background scenary
 - Improve shooting feature to allow jumping and shooting simultaneously
 - Add squat feature
