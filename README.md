Simple jump and shoot game written in assembly, based on the [processor](https://github.com/simoesusp/Processador-ICMC) developed by ICMC-USP, under the guidance of professor [Eduardo do Valle Sim√µes](https://github.com/simoesusp)

## Installation and Usage
To run the game, access the project of the processor mentioned above, and use the simulator to run the game
To play, there are four basic commands
 - Use "Space" on the initial screen to start the game
 - Use "w" to jump and avoid obstacles
 - Use "s" to shoot and destroy obstacles
 - Use "r" on the Game Over screen to return to the Start Screen

## Known bugs
 1. When the character collides with the "middle" obstacle, resulting in the game over, and the player returns to the Start Screen (presses 'r'), the strings printed on the Start and the Game screens are broken.

## Ideas for improvement
The game can be further developed to becoma a platform game. For this, here are a few ideas on what to add:
 - Feature to move the character horizontally, allowing it to walk on the screen
 - Add background scenary
 - Improve shooting feature to allow jumping and shooting simultaneously
 - Add squat feature
